# Virtual Machine Consolidation in Haskell

This is a solution to a variant of the problem
specified [here](./spec/project-1.pdf) using SAT. This problem was part of the
2016/2017 course on
[Algorithms for Computational Logic](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/ALC9/2016-2017/1-semestre)
at IST, University of Lisbon. You can find an already existing solution to this
problem
[here](https://github.com/rodamber/alc/tree/53f1a9c89f96c368b67ea9e2c864f25567c3169c).

## **NOTE**

The solution does not assume that "for each VM ν ∈ V , cpu_req(ν) = 1 and ram_req(ν) = 1"
as stated at the beginning of page 2 of the [spec](./spec/project-1.pdf).
